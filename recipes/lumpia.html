    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These crispy Filipino spring rolls are filled with an aromatic pork filling, and served with your choice of dipping sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground pork</li>
        <li>Carrot</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Lumpia wrappers</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the filling. Start by mixing ground pork with onion, scallions, lots of garlic, grated carrots, kosher salt, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Fill the lumpia wrappers. Separate the thawed lumpia wrappers from one another. Working with one at a time, lay the wrapper on the work surface with one corner pointed towards your body.  Add a bit of the meat filling to one side of the wrapper and form into a 5-inch thin log.</li>
        <li>Roll the lumpia. Fold the corner closest to you tightly over the filling, then fold the sides over and crease the edges. Tightly roll the lumpia into a long, thin egg roll and use a dab of the egg white to seal the wrapper shut. Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling until you have used everything up.</li>
        <li>Fry. Cook the lumpia by shallow-frying in a skillet over medium to medium-high heat until the wrapper is deep golden-brown and crisp and the center is cooked through completely.</li>
    </ol>
